# Aidex - Artificial Intelligence assisted Dexertity 

## Vision and Objective
Integration of off-the-shelf technology to provide hands free controls.
Target beneficiary is the *tetraplegia community* (individuals with limited or no movement of 4 limbs approximately 140 thousand in North America)

**Target system cost below $1000**.
 
## Target User Characteristics
- Persons with *spinal cord injuries resulting in quadriplegia*: little physical movement except for voice, eyes, breath (respirator-cycle limited) and possibly limited motion in a finger (no movement when cold)
- Hearing and vision is functional.
- Requires respirator 24/7 via tracheostomy.
- System needed for both wheelchair and bed reclining positions
- Currently uses a mouth pointer stick to control touch screen.
 
## Solution Set Functionality: Complete hands free control
- Environmental control: temperature, cooling, lights, appliances, etc.
- Cell phone – dialing call lists or by number and rapidly answering incoming
- Computer control –keyboard and mouse
- Media remote control 
- Wheel chair controls – alternative to thumb control (control may be lost due to degrading physical ability & fatigue)
- Voices commands primary with emergency back-up (possibly eye control), in case of voice loss.
- Control device must be mobile and include power back-up in case of outage.

 
## Solution Impact
Reduces time to activate controls and minimizes effort and physical fatigue on user.
